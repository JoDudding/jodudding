## Kia ora ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Jo Dudding, currently a Senior Data Scientist with BNZ in Auckland, New Zealand. I have over 25 years of experience analysing data and providing insights and models across difference areas of banking including product, retail, marketing, credit risk, strategy, human resources, economics, and financial crime.

I have been programming in R, SAS and SQL using techniques such as propensity modelling, survival analysis, survey analysis, segmentation, and profiling. I have experience using big data in Hadoop via Spark

Supporting my technical skills, I am experienced in managing the stakeholder relationship, presenting analysis and documenting processes and results.

I have been continuing to learn new tools, platforms and techniques and frequently share my knowledge with the BNZ analytics community both formally and informally

Projects you'll find here:

- [sewing-bee](https://github.com/JoDudding/sewing-bee) extacts information from the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Sewing_Bee) pages for the [Great British Sewing Bee](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03myqj2). I look at the rankings and wins for the first four episodes for the sewers that lasted until then, to see the likelihood of becoming the overall winner.
- [SLICED](https://github.com/JoDudding/sliced) is like the TV Show Chopped but for data science. Competitors get a never-before-seen dataset and two-hours to code a solution to a prediction challenge. Contestants get points for the best model plus bonus points for data visualization, votes from the audience, and more. This repo is my attempt to build some models using the SLICED datasets and has a [GitHub Pages website - jodudding.github.io/sliced/](https://jodudding.github.io/sliced/)
- [#eqnz](https://github.com/JoDudding/eqnz) is a Quarto dashboard that uses an API to pull earthquake data for New Zealand from GeoNet. [GitHub Pages website - jodudding.github.io/sliced/](https://jodudding.github.io/eqnz/)
- [Advent of code 2022](https://github.com/JoDudding/advent-of-code) is where I attempted the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles. [GitHub Pages website - jodudding.github.io/advent-of-code](https://jodudding.github.io/advent-of-code/)
